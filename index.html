        <p>In this entry, I describe how the open brief allowed our group to explore ideas collaboratively, mirroring real-world project dynamics.

          <p>The project began with an open brief: produce an industry-facing report. We weren’t given fixed roles or set topics, just a general direction and time to develop something meaningful as a group. These early sessions gave us the space to figure things out and were great for reflecting real-world projects where things rarely begin with a detailed plan or formal roles. <br><br>            
            In the first meetings, we worked in pairs and small groups to generate ideas that could add value to the report. We first set out with individual thinking where I initially thought about infrastructure and investment needs and funding. The next exercise involved working in pairs to identify five questions or topic areas we felt were worth exploring. This gradual build into group working was a great way to help those with less experience progress into larger group working and it helped to start thinking about where our skills and interests might fit into the project. I suggested looking at internationalisation, specifically the presence and role of international artists at local festivals, as it felt valuable, relevant, and achievable. </p>

        <p>In this entry, I reflect on how early idea development helped us understand each other's interests and build momentum as a group. While our smaller group explored decentralisation and local infrastructure, I anticipated that the wider team would recognise the value of focusing on internationalisation through festival data, which felt both relevant and achievable.<span class="AI"> - Summary powered by AI</span></p>

          <p>At this point, we were just exploring ideas and the process helped us build an understanding of people's interests. After starting in pairs, we progressed to smaller groups of four to begin developing our ideas. I worked with Nathaniel and Jack to refine some of the earlier ideas. In that group, we shifted focus from internationalisation to decentralisation and local infrastructure. While I was also interested in exploring these topics further, I had a feeling the larger project group would pick up on the value of examining festival data to the internationalisation section. It felt achievable, albeit potentially time consuming. <br><br>
           You could feel very early on the project was quickly building momentum. The group was engaged, and we quickly created a collaborative space where ideas were encouraged, and discussions stayed focused. The occasional humour across the group helped us bond and played a part in creating a positive working environment, something that stayed consistent throughout the project. </p>

          <p>I missed the group meeting where we were assigning focus areas due to illness, but because of my input in early discussions I was assigned to the internationalisation section. It was reassuring to see that my contributions were recognised and that decisions were being made with the whole group in mind. I worked closely with Owen to develop the section. While four or five people were initially assigned to this part of the report, in practice, meetings usually just involved the two of us. That said, as a group we made quick progress; we outlined a rough structure, started shaping our responsibilities. Me and Owen drafted an opening paragraph for the section and tried to include others when distributing duties and roles. We discussed how to navigate group attendance in meetings and with the academic nuance of group working in mind, we were supported by Andrew to maintain our steady progress. </p>

      <h2>Finalising the Survey Questionnaire</h2>

      <div class="summary">
        <p>In this entry, I reflect on finalising our survey, focusing on how audiences perceive international artists at UK festivals and drafting key questions to explore this. Collaborating closely with Owen and the wider group, we refined the questionnaire for clarity and research quality, marking a clear shift from planning to data collection and bringing the internationalisation section to life.<span class="AI"> - Summary powered by AI</span></p>

          <p>We also took a step closer to finalising our survey questions. My focus was on understanding how audiences view international artists performing at UK festivals and whether they felt it added value, influenced their attendance, or detracted from the identity of the event. <br><br>A couple of the questions I drafted included:<br><br>
&bull; Would the inclusion of international artists make you more likely to attend a festival or gig?<br><br>
&bull; Should Gloucestershire music festivals focus more on local talent or international talent?<br><br>
</p></div>
<div class="det_of">
  <p>The wider group reviewed and refined each other’s survey questions before it went live. This helped improve the structure and clarity across all sections. We made small but important changes, like allowing multiple responses for certain questions, adding “prefer not to say” options, and including open-text fields for extra feedback. We also ensured each question had five response options (where relevant) to align with professional research practices. We used university channels like StaffNet and support from our academic contacts to boost reach and tried to promote it through our personal networks to help. <br><br>
This was the point where the internationalisation section started to take shape. Working with Owen was smooth: we shared feedback and collaborated easily, and our ideas worked well alongside each other, which gave the section balance. There was also a clear shift from early-stage planning into actual delivery. We were no longer just suggesting ideas; we were setting the groundwork to collect valuable data. </p>

      <h2>Festival Data: Defining Categories and Structuring the Process </h2>

      <div class="summary">
        <p>In this entry, I explain how we structured the process for collecting festival data to complement audience insights in the internationalisation section. I helped define clear categories for local, national, and international artists, ensuring consistent data collection across events, and contributed to decisions that focused on where artists were based and working rather than just their origin.<span class="AI"> - Summary powered by AI</span></p>

          <p>As we finalised the survey and began shaping the interviews, we planned how we’d collect and organise festival data. We knew the internationalisation section needed to go beyond audience opinion, we also needed to show how festivals were actually booking artists. The challenge was to create a data set that could meaningfully compare local, national, and international artist presence across different events and years. 
<br><br>
We began by outlining how to collect the data accurately. After checking in with Andrew for Cheltenham Jazz Festival, we used their official brochures and the Around Town guide to make sure we were capturing both the ticketed artists and those playing free events on the different stages around the town. For 2000 Trees, I relied on ClashFinder, which had been promoted by the festival as the best way to plan your weekend across the years. 
          </p></div><div class="det_of"><p>
Before collecting any names, we agreed on how we would define local, national, and international artists. I suggested a two-stage process, first collect the line-ups, then research where each artist is based. Artists based in Gloucestershire were classed as local. Artists based in the UK but outside Gloucestershire were national. Artists based outside the UK and flying in for the event were international. There were edge cases we needed to consider and prepare for which I found we did well. For example, Mimi Barks, originally from Berlin but now based in London, was classed as national. We made a clear decision that being “international” meant being currently based outside the UK and travelling into the country as a deciding factor. The point was to focus on where the artist was currently working and how available they were to a UK audience, not just where they were born. </p>

          <p>As the project progressed, it became clear that a significant amount of the group’s Cheltenham Jazz Festival data had been collected inconsistently with our guidelines. Artists had been recorded multiple times, some weren’t artists at all, and the national/international categorisations hadn’t been applied properly. I couldn’t pinpoint exactly what was wrong, but there were enough inconsistencies across entries that I decided to restart the Jazz Festival data process from scratch to make sure what we included in the report was accurate and usable. </p>

          <p>Owen had understandably shifted his focus to the interview section, so I took on rebuilding the Jazz Festival dataset and collecting the 2000 Trees data. Owen took the lead on the survey data analysis and interviews, with some input and feedback from me to balance the workload. While the situation wasn’t ideal, I was okay with adapting my role. I was already invested in the structure, and I wanted to make sure the section delivered something solid which it couldn’t do with wildly incorrect data. </p>

          <p>I also changed the original method we set out to use for collecting 2000 Trees festival lineups, having set out to use tour posters. This is a great example of how my thinking evolved across the project. Not just focusing on getting a list of festival lineups, I wanted to accurately collect the data to establish a solid foundation for the analysis. Another example of this evolution was once I’d collected the core data, I thought about cross-checking it, and decided to check the festival’s social media posts to catch any late changes or updates. This did impact the results as several artists withdrew at the last minute. While confirming artist locations, I also checked their social media activity around the time of the festival. This helped me rule out two or three artists who had cancelled just before their set. However, most cancelled artists were replaced, with the overall totals for national and international artists likely balancing out. </p>

          <p>Throughout the project, I relied on a combination of practical research tools, software, and industry reading to support the accuracy and direction of the section.<br><br>I used a mix of official sources and third-party tools for the data collection. ClashFinder was essential for 2000 Trees, especially as it had been promoted by the festival as the best way to navigate line-ups. For Cheltenham Jazz Festival, I used the official brochure and the Around Town guide to gather the full range of performances. Where necessary, I cross-checked artist appearances using social media activity, either through the artists’ own posts or updates from the festivals. This helped confirm cancellations or changes that weren’t reflected elsewhere. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="det_of">
          <p>Once I’d collected and organised the data, I ran it through AI software (ChatGPT) as a secondary check. I asked it to scan for any missing artists from ClashFinder and any inconsistencies in artist labelling. For example, if I’d marked someone as international in one year and national in another. I also used it to see if I’d missed any obvious trends in the data or any points that might stand out in analysis. It didn’t pick up anything significant and simply reinforced what I’d already observed, but it was a useful checkpoint especially given the amount of data being handled. <br><br>As a project group, we regularly checked over the progress of the report and made amendments as we progressed. I focused on keeping the festival data section clean, structured, and aligned with the wider report. Between us we made sure the tone and framing stayed consistent across the internationalisation section. The tools and sources I used in this project helped ensure my contribution was accurate, reliable, and met industry standards. </p>

        <p>In this entry, I detail how I analysed the festival data using pivot tables to identify key trends, such as the growth of 2000 Trees and post-pandemic shifts at Cheltenham Jazz Festival.

          <p>Once I was confident in the data, I moved into writing the analysis. I skipped the introduction and began noting down trends and patterns as they emerged while reviewing the data. I used pivot tables to break the data down, which made it easier to compare totals across local, national, and international artists. These were later used in the report. </p>

          <p>From there, I started stepping back to better see what stood out. One key trend was the consistent growth of 2000 Trees, particularly in national and international acts. In contrast, Cheltenham Jazz Festival saw more fluctuation, local artist numbers increased significantly post-pandemic, while international acts declined. I later found out this was due to changes in international exchange programs and festival operations, after the pandemic and Brexit. These differences also helped highlight how each festival responded to external challenges. </p>

        <div class="det_of">
          <br><p>I focused on making the festival data section feel like a professional piece of writing that could sit comfortably in our industry-facing report. I avoided over-interpreting the numbers and concentrated on what the data clearly showed and could be visually supported. Once I had a strong structure in place and was close to finalising the draft, I circled back to the introduction. I made sure it clearly set up what the reader could expect and gave enough context to keep them engaged. <br><br>There wasn’t any redrafting needed between me and Owen at this stage. We’d split the section clearly, had a good foundation to build on, and our writing styles worked well side by side. The final piece blended smoothly, and I felt confident that my contributions added value to the report by grounding the internationalisation section in real, evidence-based insight. </p>

          <p>As my dissertation focused on the impact of Brexit on UK artists touring the EU, I was already immersed in current research around international mobility, visas, and the broader implications for the live music sector. Constantly reading industry reports, case studies, and policy commentary fed directly into how I framed my contribution. This reading meant I wasn’t just focused on the data, I was thinking about what’s changed, why it might be changing, and how that reflects the wider shifts in the UK live music landscape.  </p>

          <p>I regularly reviewed articles from sources like UK Music, the Musicians’ Union, and LIVE, and kept a close eye on commentary around Brexit, the pandemic, and the changing structure of international touring through both projects. This reading influenced how I approached my contribution, both in tone and in the way I framed the trends in the data. </p>

        <div class="det_of">
          <p>This wider context also directly shaped how I framed parts of the section. I wasn’t trying to overstate anything, but I did want to reflect what was happening across the industry and how it was affecting local festivals. This was an industry report not a news article. Lines like the one below came out of this thinking, combining the data with a view of the bigger picture: </p>
<p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%; font-style:italic;">“The evolving lineups of 2000 Trees Festival and Cheltenham Jazz Festival reflect broader shifts in the UK live music industry and highlights how festivals have adapted to external pressures, audience trends, and industry challenges.” </p>

          <p>My focus throughout the project was on delivering the internationalisation section and contributing to group discussions on the direction, content and design. I took the lead on collecting, cleaning, and categorising the festival data, shaping the structure of the section, and writing the analysis. I also worked with Owen to develop the survey questions and to ensure the tone and layout were consistent across the full section. We split the workload clearly, and our ability to collaborate effectively helped make this an efficient and straightforward process. <br><br>That said, the initial group originally assigned to our section dropped off early, and in the end, it was essentially just me and Owen who delivered it. The early Jazz Festival data wasn’t collected consistently with our agreed system and was incomplete, so I made the decision to start again. It made more sense to rebuild it properly than try to patch what was there, and it felt like the right call given the importance of maintaining reliable data for the section. </p>

          <p>While our section’s small group lost wider collaborative momentum, the general project group remained strong throughout. The collaboration around design, formatting, and presentation was effective. The group stayed engaged and contributed consistently across the project, and there was a shared sense of accountability that kept the wider report moving forward. I think the group found the benefit towards the end with how well everything came together. <br><br>I’m proud of what the group delivered, and of my contributions. The section is clean, evidence-led, and adds real value to the report. Despite some of the challenges around group engagement, the experience reinforced how I work best; where needed I can take ownership and lead, support others’ work, help keep things structured, and offer some out-the-box thinking. </p>

      <h2>1. Role Selection</h2>
      <div class="summary">
        <p>In this entry, I explain my decision to assist the stage manager on the Big Top stage at Cheltenham Jazz Festival 2025, choosing a hands-on, team-focused role over more management-oriented options. My aim was to engage directly with the core operations of a major performance space, gain practical experience, and observe professional setups in a high-profile environment.</p>

          <p>As part of the Production Company module, we were given the opportunity to choose from various roles at Cheltenham Jazz Festival 2025. These were introduced and explained in lectures. We could choose from roles that were either centred on site operations at stages around Cheltenham, or more crew-based roles tied to specific stages on the main site. While some students gravitated toward roles that offered leadership or management experience, I opted for something more embedded by assisting the stage manager on the Big Top stage, the festival’s main performance space.
<br><br>
I didn’t go into this with a clear rationale or a strong ambition to work the biggest stage. It wasn’t about chasing prestige either. The smaller venues didn’t really appeal to me, and I felt that others might benefit more from the experience of the more management-focused roles, given my background. For me, the Big Top offered the chance to be hands-on and contribute in a space where I could still experience the core principles of teamwork. It also had potential for some informal networking, the chance to see some big names perform, and to observe experienced professional setups in action. </p>

The idea was to familiarise ourselves with the space and get a sense of the layout before it became operational. After a quick catch-up and a tour around the site, we were handed over to the stage-building crew. The stage manager wasn’t due on site until the following day, and the crew member we were handed over to wasn’t aware of or prepared for us to be there. 
<br><br>
We stayed for a while and watched from a distance as the lighting rig was being set up. As there was no interaction or direction from anyone on-site, I decided to check in with the office to see if there was anything we could help with elsewhere before heading home to prepare for the week ahead. The visit was still helpful in that we got to see the space and walk around the different stages and areas before it opened to the public. </p>

          <p>The role was to assist the Big Top stage manager, James, with whatever was needed before, during, and after performances. This usually meant staying close by, following his direction, and checking in with the artists’ touring crew to see if they needed any extra support, though most of the time they had everything covered. The core of the job was to help keep things moving on and off stage, and to make sure the performance area stayed clear and safe between sets. 
<br><br>
The pace was as expected: long periods of waiting around followed by bursts of high-energy work, usually during changeovers or load-ins. James was clear and direct, so I quickly got used to how he ran the stage area. From there, it was mostly about repeating the same core processes across the week. Having a quieter start to the week gave us time to familiarise ourselves with the role, the equipment, and the general processes to follow for when changeover times became tighter. </p>

          <p>While some tasks varied slightly depending on the artist or performance setup, the overall focus was always the same: support the stage manager and contribute to keeping the Big Top running smoothly, safely, and on time. 

This included helping with load-ins and load-outs, moving cases and equipment between trucks and the stage, and rotating platforms into position, guided by either James or a member of the artist’s touring crew. I also assisted with building and breaking down staging platforms to specific sizes. This was generally a case of adding legs, connecting units, and clearing them once no longer needed.

I also helped artists get on and off stage quickly and safely. This sometimes meant marking hazards like loose cables and platform edges or opening the stage curtain. I occasionally collected water and towels from artist liaison ahead of performances and made sure they were cleared quickly afterwards, as water and electrics don’t mix. 
<br><br>
There were a few moments where I assisted with backline or drum kit setup. With limited experience in that area, I mostly took on straightforward tasks like lifting items or folding hardware. Outside of these more active moments, one of the main expectations was simply to keep the stage area clear and to be ready to act when needed. </p>

      <div class="summary">
        <p>In this section, I reflect on how I approached the role with a focus on consistency, awareness, and knowing when and how to contribute without needing direction at every step. I wasn’t there to lead or take initiative in a visible way, but to quietly support the team, adapt to the workflow, and help maintain a smooth-running stage by being present, reliable, and responsive to the needs of the production.</p>

      <div class="details-wrapper">
        <div class="det_of">
          <p>From the start, I was aware that my role wasn’t about taking the lead or trying to innovate; it was about showing up, fitting into an existing system, and supporting the processes in place. With that in mind, my contribution came through consistency, judgement, and being able to act without needing things explained to me at every turn. That said, the nature of the role still required constant communication with James and the wider teams. 
<br><br>
Because of my past experiences, I didn’t require much onboarding. I understood how a changeover flows, how backline is moved safely and efficiently, and when the most helpful thing is simply to stay out of the way. I didn’t need to be told where to stand or when to step back, I could read the room and make those decisions. This kind of awareness made me useful, even when I wasn’t doing anything hands-on. 
<br><br>
I also tried to manage my time around the needs of the stage, rather than just sticking rigidly to the schedule provided. On the first day I worked with James and the production office to adjust my shifts so that I was present when there was a load-in, a changeover, or a build. This meant adjusting start and finish times to better align with the stage schedule and downtime. That flexibility came from understanding how these systems operate and recognising that it’s about being present when it counts. 
<br><br>
Throughout the week, I followed instruction without needing things repeated, asked questions when something was unclear, and quietly looked for ways to be useful even if it meant just making space and keeping the area clear for others to work. I wasn’t trying to stand out or take over. My aim was to do the job well, support the people who needed supporting, and keep things moving without adding any unnecessary noise. </p>

      <div class="summary">
        <p>In this section, I reflect on how the placement reinforced rather than introduced key professional skills I’ve developed over time. While the experience didn’t offer new learning in the traditional sense, it validated my existing knowledge of live event workflows, communication, and team dynamics. I was reminded of the importance of preparation and clear protocols, especially when unexpected issues arise, and gained a few small pieces of industry-specific knowledge that added to my practical vocabulary.</p>

          <p>What stood out the most across the week was how different my experience of the placement felt compared to others from the course. For some, it was among their first experiences of working with a professional crew, the first time seeing how artists are moved on and off stage, or how small adjustments can make a big difference during a changeover. This wasn’t down to a lack of engagement, or an issue with the placement itself, as the structure and support were strong. It was simply because I’d already seen a lot of these processes elsewhere. 
<br><br>
          </div><div class="det_of">
In previous roles, I’ve worked within live venues, built and broken down amusement rides, and worked the main stage at Black Deer Festival. In my current position at Northern Music Co. I support our roster of international touring artists with tour planning and prep, from production planning to crew coordination. Therefore, this experience didn’t present anything new to me, but it did allow me to return to familiar processes in a live, professional setting. 
<br><br>
What I took from the experience wasn’t so much growth as it was confirmation. It reminded me that I know how to carry myself within a team and in a production setting. I know how to stay useful without getting in the way, how to communicate and support other teams without overstepping, and how to follow instruction while still using my own initiative. These are things built through repetition, and I’ve been fortunate to come into this experience having refined those core skills over many years. 
<br><br>
There were some small things I picked up. I learnt that “wedges” referred to stage monitors and that “peli case” isn’t a particular item; it’s just a very good brand of case.

This was also a reminder of how unpredictable live environments can be, something that became especially clear during a power cut that interrupted a headline performance. While these moments are part of live production, it also highlighted a gap: there didn’t seem like there was a clear show stop procedure or agreement in place, which created confusion across the board about how to respond. It was a reminder of how important advance planning, communication, and agreed protocols are, even in well-run setups like this. </p>

      <h2>5.3 Considering Future Directions  </h2>

        <p>This part of the experience prompted me to think more critically about the relationship between technical and managerial roles on tour. Observing the separation between logistical oversight and hands-on technical knowledge made me reflect on my own skill set and career direction. With my existing experience supporting international touring artists and coordinating production logistics through NMC, I’ve begun to see tour management as a realistic and fitting progression—one where I could bridge both worlds and bring added value through a combined understanding of planning and production.</p>

          <p>This experience also made me reflect on the divide between management and technical roles within touring. I noticed that many tour managers working on these larger setups don’t always have much hands-on knowledge of the equipment or infrastructure they travel with. I was surprised by how little some knew which is not a criticism, just something I hadn’t quite expected. It's made me consider whether that’s a direction I might want to explore further. Given that I already work closely with international artists, venues, and production teams through NMC, the idea of moving into a tour management role, with a solid logistical base and some technical understanding to build on, feels like a natural next step for me that's worth serious consideration. </p>

          <p>Although the placement didn’t really offer me any new learning or unfamiliar challenges, it gave me something just as valuable: a chance to confirm that I already know how to operate within this kind of environment. I could trust my judgement, contribute meaningfully, and support a professional team without needing to be micro-managed. While it might not sound exciting, it’s essential as I transition into full-time employment within the industry. 
<br><br>
It also gave me the space to refine existing habits. Repeating actions within an industry-specific role reinforced what I already knew, and helped better prepare me to leave academia and re-enter the working world. 
<br><br>
Looking ahead, this experience has made me think more seriously about where I could fit in within the touring landscape. Tour management now feels like a realistic direction worth considering. It feels like it could be a natural progression, and one I’ll continue to explore. </p>

Being part of the team on the Big Top stage meant working alongside a professional crew, watching performances from just off stage, and seeing how much coordination goes into something that, from the outside, feels seamless. 
<br><br>
I also had the chance to see some top-class performers up close — not just in terms of musicianship, but in the way they carried themselves on stage. There was a level of professionalism and showmanship that really stood out, and it was a reminder of the standard that's expected at this level of live performance. 
<br><br>
It was a privilege to be involved, even in a small way. I worked with people at the top of their game, saw some incredible sets, and got to experience the atmosphere of a large-scale live event from the inside. That sense of shared effort, professionalism, and respect for the craft was a reminder of why I want to continue working in this industry.</p>
