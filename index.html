        <p>In this entry, I describe how the open brief allowed our group to explore ideas collaboratively, mirroring real-world project dynamics.

          <p>The project began with an open brief: produce an industry-facing report. We weren’t given fixed roles or set topics, just a general direction and time to develop something meaningful as a group. These early sessions gave us the space to figure things out and were great for reflecting real-world projects where things rarely begin with a detailed plan or formal roles. <br><br>            
            In the first meetings, we worked in pairs and small groups to generate ideas that could add value to the report. We first set out with individual thinking where I initially thought about infrastructure and investment needs and funding. The next exercise involved working in pairs to identify five questions or topic areas we felt were worth exploring. This gradual build into group working was a great way to help those with less experience progress into larger group working and it helped to start thinking about where our skills and interests might fit into the project. I suggested looking at internationalisation, specifically the presence and role of international artists at local festivals, as it felt valuable, relevant, and achievable. </p>

        <p>In this entry, I reflect on how early idea development helped us understand each other's interests and build momentum as a group. While our smaller group explored decentralisation and local infrastructure, I anticipated that the wider team would recognise the value of focusing on internationalisation through festival data, which felt both relevant and achievable.<span class="AI"> - Summary powered by AI</span></p>

          <p>At this point, we were just exploring ideas and the process helped us build an understanding of people's interests. After starting in pairs, we progressed to smaller groups of four to begin developing our ideas. I worked with Nathaniel and Jack to refine some of the earlier ideas. In that group, we shifted focus from internationalisation to decentralisation and local infrastructure. While I was also interested in exploring these topics further, I had a feeling the larger project group would pick up on the value of examining festival data to the internationalisation section. It felt achievable, albeit potentially time consuming. <br><br>
           You could feel very early on the project was quickly building momentum. The group was engaged, and we quickly created a collaborative space where ideas were encouraged, and discussions stayed focused. The occasional humour across the group helped us bond and played a part in creating a positive working environment, something that stayed consistent throughout the project. </p>

          <p>I missed the group meeting where we were assigning focus areas due to illness, but because of my input in early discussions I was assigned to the internationalisation section. It was reassuring to see that my contributions were recognised and that decisions were being made with the whole group in mind. I worked closely with Owen to develop the section. While four or five people were initially assigned to this part of the report, in practice, meetings usually just involved the two of us. That said, as a group we made quick progress; we outlined a rough structure, started shaping our responsibilities. Me and Owen drafted an opening paragraph for the section and tried to include others when distributing duties and roles. We discussed how to navigate group attendance in meetings and with the academic nuance of group working in mind, we were supported by Andrew to maintain our steady progress. </p>

      <h2>Finalising the Survey Questionnaire</h2>

      <div class="summary">
        <p>In this entry, I reflect on finalising our survey, focusing on how audiences perceive international artists at UK festivals and drafting key questions to explore this. Collaborating closely with Owen and the wider group, we refined the questionnaire for clarity and research quality, marking a clear shift from planning to data collection and bringing the internationalisation section to life.<span class="AI"> - Summary powered by AI</span></p>

          <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/ryvkBg4Z/Image-4.gif" alt="Survey Questions and Responses">
          <p>We also took a step closer to finalising our survey questions. My focus was on understanding how audiences view international artists performing at UK festivals and whether they felt it added value, influenced their attendance, or detracted from the identity of the event. <br><br>A couple of the questions I drafted included:<br><br>
&bull; Would the inclusion of international artists make you more likely to attend a festival or gig?<br><br>
&bull; Should Gloucestershire music festivals focus more on local talent or international talent?<br><br>
</p></div>
<div class="det_of">
  <p>The wider group reviewed and refined each other’s survey questions before it went live. This helped improve the structure and clarity across all sections. We made small but important changes, like allowing multiple responses for certain questions, adding “prefer not to say” options, and including open-text fields for extra feedback. We also ensured each question had five response options (where relevant) to align with professional research practices. We used university channels like StaffNet and support from our academic contacts to boost reach and tried to promote it through our personal networks to help. <br><br>
This was the point where the internationalisation section started to take shape. Working with Owen was smooth: we shared feedback and collaborated easily, and our ideas worked well alongside each other, which gave the section balance. There was also a clear shift from early-stage planning into actual delivery. We were no longer just suggesting ideas; we were setting the groundwork to collect valuable data. </p>

      <h2>Festival Data: Defining Categories and Structuring the Process </h2>

      <div class="summary">
        <p>In this entry, I explain how we structured the process for collecting festival data to complement audience insights in the internationalisation section. I helped define clear categories for local, national, and international artists, ensuring consistent data collection across events, and contributed to decisions that focused on where artists were based and working rather than just their origin.<span class="AI"> - Summary powered by AI</span></p>

          <p>As we finalised the survey and began shaping the interviews, we planned how we’d collect and organise festival data. We knew the internationalisation section needed to go beyond audience opinion, we also needed to show how festivals were actually booking artists. The challenge was to create a data set that could meaningfully compare local, national, and international artist presence across different events and years. 
<br><br>
We began by outlining how to collect the data accurately. After checking in with Andrew for Cheltenham Jazz Festival, we used their official brochures and the Around Town guide to make sure we were capturing both the ticketed artists and those playing free events on the different stages around the town. For 2000 Trees, I relied on ClashFinder, which had been promoted by the festival as the best way to plan your weekend across the years. 
          </p></div><div class="det_of"><p>
Before collecting any names, we agreed on how we would define local, national, and international artists. I suggested a two-stage process, first collect the line-ups, then research where each artist is based. Artists based in Gloucestershire were classed as local. Artists based in the UK but outside Gloucestershire were national. Artists based outside the UK and flying in for the event were international. There were edge cases we needed to consider and prepare for which I found we did well. For example, Mimi Barks, originally from Berlin but now based in London, was classed as national. We made a clear decision that being “international” meant being currently based outside the UK and travelling into the country as a deciding factor. The point was to focus on where the artist was currently working and how available they were to a UK audience, not just where they were born. </p>

          <p>As the project progressed, it became clear that a significant amount of the group’s Cheltenham Jazz Festival data had been collected inconsistently with our guidelines. Artists had been recorded multiple times, some weren’t artists at all, and the national/international categorisations hadn’t been applied properly. I couldn’t pinpoint exactly what was wrong, but there were enough inconsistencies across entries that I decided to restart the Jazz Festival data process from scratch to make sure what we included in the report was accurate and usable. </p>

          <p>Owen had understandably shifted his focus to the interview section, so I took on rebuilding the Jazz Festival dataset and collecting the 2000 Trees data. Owen took the lead on the survey data analysis and interviews, with some input and feedback from me to balance the workload. While the situation wasn’t ideal, I was okay with adapting my role. I was already invested in the structure, and I wanted to make sure the section delivered something solid which it couldn’t do with wildly incorrect data. </p>

          <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/QtH2PWdr/Image-8.gif" alt="Tour Poster vs ClashFinder gif">
          <p>I also changed the original method we set out to use for collecting 2000 Trees festival lineups, having set out to use tour posters. This is a great example of how my thinking evolved across the project. Not just focusing on getting a list of festival lineups, I wanted to accurately collect the data to establish a solid foundation for the analysis. Another example of this evolution was once I’d collected the core data, I thought about cross-checking it, and decided to check the festival’s social media posts to catch any late changes or updates. This did impact the results as several artists withdrew at the last minute. While confirming artist locations, I also checked their social media activity around the time of the festival. This helped me rule out two or three artists who had cancelled just before their set. However, most cancelled artists were replaced, with the overall totals for national and international artists likely balancing out. </p>

      <div class="summary reverse">
        <p>In this entry, I explain how I used a mix of official sources, third-party tools like ClashFinder, and social media to ensure accurate festival data collection.

          <p>Throughout the project, I relied on a combination of practical research tools, software, and industry reading to support the accuracy and direction of the section.<br><br>I used a mix of official sources and third-party tools for the data collection. ClashFinder was essential for 2000 Trees, especially as it had been promoted by the festival as the best way to navigate line-ups. For Cheltenham Jazz Festival, I used the official brochure and the Around Town guide to gather the full range of performances. Where necessary, I cross-checked artist appearances using social media activity, either through the artists’ own posts or updates from the festivals. This helped confirm cancellations or changes that weren’t reflected elsewhere. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="det_of">
          <p>Once I’d collected and organised the data, I ran it through AI software (ChatGPT) as a secondary check. I asked it to scan for any missing artists from ClashFinder and any inconsistencies in artist labelling. For example, if I’d marked someone as international in one year and national in another. I also used it to see if I’d missed any obvious trends in the data or any points that might stand out in analysis. It didn’t pick up anything significant and simply reinforced what I’d already observed, but it was a useful checkpoint especially given the amount of data being handled. <br><br>As a project group, we regularly checked over the progress of the report and made amendments as we progressed. I focused on keeping the festival data section clean, structured, and aligned with the wider report. Between us we made sure the tone and framing stayed consistent across the internationalisation section. The tools and sources I used in this project helped ensure my contribution was accurate, reliable, and met industry standards. </p>

      <h2>Festival Data: Analysis and Insight Writing </h2>
      <br>
      <div class="summary">
        <p>In this entry, I detail how I analysed the festival data using pivot tables to identify key trends, such as the growth of 2000 Trees and post-pandemic shifts at Cheltenham Jazz Festival. I focused on producing clear, evidence-based insights that aligned with the report’s professional tone, and worked seamlessly with Owen’s writing to create a cohesive, high-quality section.<span class="AI"> - Summary powered by AI</span></p>

          <p>Once I was confident in the data, I moved into writing the analysis. I skipped the introduction and began noting down trends and patterns as they emerged while reviewing the data. I used pivot tables to break the data down, which made it easier to compare totals across local, national, and international artists. These were later used in the report. </p>

          <p>From there, I started stepping back to better see what stood out. One key trend was the consistent growth of 2000 Trees, particularly in national and international acts. In contrast, Cheltenham Jazz Festival saw more fluctuation, local artist numbers increased significantly post-pandemic, while international acts declined. I later found out this was due to changes in international exchange programs and festival operations, after the pandemic and Brexit. These differences also helped highlight how each festival responded to external challenges. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="det_of">
          <br><p>I focused on making the festival data section feel like a professional piece of writing that could sit comfortably in our industry-facing report. I avoided over-interpreting the numbers and concentrated on what the data clearly showed and could be visually supported. Once I had a strong structure in place and was close to finalising the draft, I circled back to the introduction. I made sure it clearly set up what the reader could expect and gave enough context to keep them engaged. <br><br>There wasn’t any redrafting needed between me and Owen at this stage. We’d split the section clearly, had a good foundation to build on, and our writing styles worked well side by side. The final piece blended smoothly, and I felt confident that my contributions added value to the report by grounding the internationalisation section in real, evidence-based insight. </p>

          <p>As my dissertation focused on the impact of Brexit on UK artists touring the EU, I was already immersed in current research around international mobility, visas, and the broader implications for the live music sector. Constantly reading industry reports, case studies, and policy commentary fed directly into how I framed my contribution. This reading meant I wasn’t just focused on the data, I was thinking about what’s changed, why it might be changing, and how that reflects the wider shifts in the UK live music landscape.  </p>

          <img src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/508699/landscape-placeholder.svg" alt="some industry reports">
          <p>I regularly reviewed articles from sources like UK Music, the Musicians’ Union, and LIVE, and kept a close eye on commentary around Brexit, the pandemic, and the changing structure of international touring through both projects. This reading influenced how I approached my contribution, both in tone and in the way I framed the trends in the data. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="det_of">
          <p>This wider context also directly shaped how I framed parts of the section. I wasn’t trying to overstate anything, but I did want to reflect what was happening across the industry and how it was affecting local festivals. This was an industry report not a news article. Lines like the one below came out of this thinking, combining the data with a view of the bigger picture: </p>
<p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%; font-style:italic;">“The evolving lineups of 2000 Trees Festival and Cheltenham Jazz Festival reflect broader shifts in the UK live music industry and highlights how festivals have adapted to external pressures, audience trends, and industry challenges.” </p>
<p>It wasn’t just about reporting totals; it was about making sure the writing reflected what people across the sector were already talking about. </p>

        <p>In this entry, I reflect on leading the internationalisation section—collecting and analysing festival data, co-developing the survey, and ensuring consistency with Owen.

          <p>My focus throughout the project was on delivering the internationalisation section and contributing to group discussions on the direction, content and design. I took the lead on collecting, cleaning, and categorising the festival data, shaping the structure of the section, and writing the analysis. I also worked with Owen to develop the survey questions and to ensure the tone and layout were consistent across the full section. We split the workload clearly, and our ability to collaborate effectively helped make this an efficient and straightforward process. <br><br>That said, the initial group originally assigned to our section dropped off early, and in the end, it was essentially just me and Owen who delivered it. The early Jazz Festival data wasn’t collected consistently with our agreed system and was incomplete, so I made the decision to start again. It made more sense to rebuild it properly than try to patch what was there, and it felt like the right call given the importance of maintaining reliable data for the section. </p>

          <p>While our section’s small group lost wider collaborative momentum, the general project group remained strong throughout. The collaboration around design, formatting, and presentation was effective. The group stayed engaged and contributed consistently across the project, and there was a shared sense of accountability that kept the wider report moving forward. I think the group found the benefit towards the end with how well everything came together. <br><br>I’m proud of what the group delivered, and of my contributions. The section is clean, evidence-led, and adds real value to the report. Despite some of the challenges around group engagement, the experience reinforced how I work best; where needed I can take ownership and lead, support others’ work, help keep things structured, and offer some out-the-box thinking. </p>
